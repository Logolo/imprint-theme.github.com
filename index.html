          <div>
            <p>You&rsquo;re a writer. Except you don&rsquo;t write. You tweet, you update, you reblog pictures. But you don&rsquo;t write because your writing has nowhere to go.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s give your writing somewhere to go.</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s get started with <strong>Imprint.</strong></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Imprint</strong> is an ambitious plan to improve the way your writing lives and spreads online. We&rsquo;ll be giving you new tools to distribute your work, track who&rsquo;s reading it and writing about it, and deepen the readers&rsquo; ability to interact with it.</p>
        <p>That&rsquo;s all just a short ways down the road.</p>
        <p class="kickoff">But right now, we&rsquo;re kicking things off with a Tumblr theme.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="stretch" id="your-home-page">
      <h1>Your home page</h1>
      <img height="919" src="images/your-home-page.png" width="650">
      <ul class="bubbles">
        <li class="lefty" id="o-bio">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2 class="l1">Your Bio</h2>
          <p>First and foremost, your homepage is about you.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="o-blurbs">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2 class="l1">Blurbs</h2>
          <p>Are people talking you up on Twitter? Plug their kind words into this theme and bask a little in the glow.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="o-work">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>Your Work</h2>
          <p>All of your work, organized the way you want it.</p>

          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>Spread the Word</h2>
          <p>We want to spread your writing far and wide, and we&rsquo;re including an ever-expanding toolset to help your fans do just that.</p>
          <ul id="spread">
            <li class="reblog"><strong>Reblogging</strong> is explicity encouraged in Imprint.</li>
            <li class="longreads">Integration with <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://longreads.com">Longreads</a></strong>, so that users can automatically recommend your work to this popular compendium of long-form writing</li>
       	    <li class="readlater">Finally, Imprint understands that your readers might want to save your work for later perusal. Quick links to <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a></strong> and <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://readability.com">Readability</a></strong> let them take your writing wherever they want to go.</li>
          </ul>

        <li id="o-reading">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2 class="l3">Writing for Reading</h2>
          <p>Needless to say, Imprint isn&rsquo;t just about writing. It&rsquo;s also about reading. Hence: thoughtfully typeset text, with a generous measure, smart leading, and no distractions.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lefty" id="o-images">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>Elegant Images</h2>
          <p>Yes, Imprint is designed for text, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the images you include won&rsquo;t look beautiful. We keep your writing uncluttered by displaying images alongside the text, where they won&rsquo;t interrupt the flow of your work.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lefty" id="o-progress">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>Halfway There</h2>
          <p>With Imprint&rsquo;s progress indicators running down the page, readers won&rsquo;t lose track of how much of your piece they&rsquo;ve enjoyed.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lefty" id="o-sidenotes">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>A Brief Aside</h2>
          <p>Ever find yourself digressing, but want to find room for those stray thoughts? Or maybe you want to reference outside material without breaking your rhetorical stride. Imprint makes it easy to add sidenotes that supplement your main body of text.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="o-tables">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2 class="l1">Tables!</h2>
          <p>Need to weigh some merits? Want to really show off some research? Creating tables has never been easier.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lefty" id="o-heads">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2 class="l1">Heads!</h2>
          <p>Finally, subheads in a Tumblr theme. And they&rsquo;re handsome, too.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="o-readlater">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>Read It Later</h2>
          <p>Sure, Imprint makes reading on the web as supple an experience as reading offline, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that readers can&rsquo;t also take it with them. Imprint readily links with readers&rsquo; Instapaper or Readability accounts, and even allows them buy a Kindle edition of your work.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lefty" id="o-portfolio">
          <div class="point"></div>
          <h2>And the Rest</h2>
          <p>Guide your reader through the rest of your writing portfolio in the way that best suits your sensibilities. Use tags, feature specfic pieces, or just list the most recent stuff you&rsquo;ve published. With Imprint, it&rsquo;s all up to you.</p>
